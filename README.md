# Tell Me What To Do

An application I built in a day for a company coding challenge. The application pulls from a couple different APIs to get activities. It also supports the functionality where a user can enter various parameters for the activities to narrow down the results. The application then pulls a picture related to the activity using a picture fetching API.
